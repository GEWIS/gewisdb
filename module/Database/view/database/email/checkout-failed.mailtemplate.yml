      <p>Dear {{FIRST_NAME}},</p>

      <p>Your payment of the membership fee has failed. We kindly ask you to try again using the following link: <a href='{{RESTART_CHECKOUT_URL}}'>{{RESTART_CHECKOUT_URL}}</a>.</p>

      <p>Have you changed your mind and do you not want to become a member after all? Then you do not have to pay again and we will delete your details in 31 days. We would also like to hear why you do not want to become a member after all, so that we can improve the registration process.</p>

      <br/>
      With kind regards,<br/>
      The board of GEWIS
