      <p>Dear {{FIRST_NAME}},</p>

      <p>We have noticed that you have not yet paid the one-time membership fee. Without the payment we cannot approve your membership. You can use the following link to start again: <a href='{{RESTART_CHECKOUT_URL}}'>{{RESTART_CHECKOUT_URL}}</a>.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Have you changed your mind and do you not want to become a member? Then you do not have to pay again and we will delete your details in 31 days. We would also like to hear why you do not want to become a member after all, so that we can improve the registration process.</li>
        <li>Did you pay by bank transfer or cash? Then your payment will be processed manually. You can ignore this email. Manual verification can take up to 5 working days. If you have not heard from us after that, please reach out.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
      With kind regards,<br/>
      The board of GEWIS
